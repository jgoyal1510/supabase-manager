This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase project's URL, anon key, and (optionally) the service role key.
2. Restart the dev server so the environment variables are available to Next.js.
3. In server components or route handlers that should run as the signed-in user, import `createSupabaseServerClient` from `src/lib/supabase`.
4. For privileged, service-role operations, call `createSupabaseServerAdminClient`.
5. Client components can call `createSupabaseBrowserClient` to interact with Supabase directly in the browser.

Both helpers validate that your environment variables are in place and automatically wire Supabase to Next.js cookies so authentication works out of the box.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
